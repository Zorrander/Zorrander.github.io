PhD student in Cognitive Robotics. I studied computer engineering in Toulouse and had the chance to study as an exchange student in two other universities. First in Seoul National University for 5 months where I got introduced to artificial intelligence and in Aalto University where I worked for the first time with robots. Now the topic of my thesis is to try and push the limits of human-robot interaction. The aim is to make the introduction of robots in households and the collaboration in industrial settings one step closer.
